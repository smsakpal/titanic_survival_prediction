project : titanic survival prediction
I've successfully completed my project on Titanic Survival Prediction as part of my internship at Bharat Intern! ðŸš¢âœ¨ This project involved analyzing passenger data and applying machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes. It was a great learning experience in data science, feature engineering, and model building. Looking forward to applying these skills to future projects!"
